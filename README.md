# maralook
Maralook was created in early 2017 with the intent of providing a price history for items on marapets.com.
Maralook has since been made public for improvements, and can be used and shared freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The project is rarely updated. Improvements will be made and accepted when needed. While the project was developed and run on PHP5, the current state of the project has been tested successfully with PHP7 with no errors.
